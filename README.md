## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Media queries are extremely useful to adapt the project to different sizes. 
This project started with a desktop first approach, of course I struggle more to complete it effectively. But once I developed a mobile-first mentality, the improvement in the workflow was noticiable.

"display: flex" made the project way more responsible than it was before I explored all its potential. 

The use of variables to switch between shades of color made it incredibly easy and effecive. 





### Continued development

I aim to improve my HTML to make it more inclusive and more readable to other developers. 

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to CSS Grid](hhttps://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) - Memorizing all CSS commands can be overwhelming, so a little help made me solidify and expand my knowledge about grid and flexbox.
